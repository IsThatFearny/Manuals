How to generate a Github SSH Key and correctly configure repositories

Use this command:

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

Use no passphrase.

Start the SSH agent:

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

Add the key to the SSH agent:

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Go to Github and add the key after copying it to your clipboard with:
(On Windows Subsystem for Linux)

clip.exe < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

(On a Linux Distro)

xclip < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub


To configure the repository, use this command while in the folder:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git


Alternatively, you can use the script that is available at https://github.com/IsThatFearny/bashscripts
