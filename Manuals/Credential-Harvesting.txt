Social Engineering: Credential Harvesting

Start the Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)

cd ~/social-engineer-toolkit

./setoolkit

Select 'Social Engineering Attacks'

Select 'Website Attack Vectors'

Select 'Credential Harvester Attack Method'

Select 'Custom Import'

At this point, find a page that you want to harvest credentials from, for example the facebook.com login page. Go to this page on your web browser, right click, and select 'Save As'. Save the file as 'index.html' into the home folder.

Type in your device's ip address

Type in the path to the folder that 'index.html' is stored in

Select 'Copy just the Index.html'

Type in the URL of the page that the Index.html is based off

Pick up a device, e.g. your phone, and type in your device's ip address. This will bring you to a login page. Use social engineering to get someone to type their credentials into the login page, and the results will be fed back to your terminal window.
